            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS by Our Proclamation of the Twenty second day of <hi>December</hi> last, We did for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reasons therein expressed, give Order for Assembling the Members of both Houses of Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon occasion of the intended Invasion of this Kingdom by the <hi>Scots:</hi> And therein promised to give Order that Care should be taken for their severall Accommodations here, whereof now the difficulty is represented to Us, in respect both the severall Lodgings in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Halls, and throughout the City are found filled with Lodgers, many whereof are taken up by Persons who have neither dependance on Us, Our deare Consort the QUEENE, nor Our Sonnes the Prince and Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> nor relation to Our Army, but are forced hither from their owne Inhabitations, by the Insolency and Tyranny of the Rebells, and so are compelled to shelter themselves under Our Protection: which Case (belonging truly to many, though not to all) We much commiserate, and doe look upon such Persons, not only as sufferers, but as Persons whose Loyalty occasions much of the Rebells malice against them, so that were We not led thereunto by Necessity, We should in no wise give the least interruption to their stay here. But since the Calling of this Assembly is so necessary, and is grounded upon so publick Considerations, We cannot avoyd it. And therefore doe hereby peremptorily Command, That all Persons, who are at present Lodged in this University, and City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who are here only for Protection, be, before Friday next, removed out of their said Lodgings here, and such Members of both Houses as are by Our said Proclamation summoned hither, be placed therein. Neverthelesse Our Intention is, and We doe hereby give them to understand, that when they shall expresse to what other place within Our Obedience they will remove, be it in what Garrison Town soever, they shall receive Recommendations from Us, to the Governours of Our said Townes or Places they will remove unto, To the end, that according to their Qualities, they may be there conveniently lodged and provided for. And Our further strict Pleasure is, That all Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers, who by their Commands here, are to have Lodgings in this City, be Lodged in no other Quarters, but those assigned unto the Souldiery. And all other Officers and Souldiers, who having Command in any other place, doe keep Lodgings in this City, that they be removed to their Quarters where their Command is. And We referre it to the Chancellour of this Our University, that all such Scholars, as he shall think fit, may be sent home, and otherwise provided for. And in respect the time appointed for the Assembly is so nigh at hand, We require the Chancellour of this Our University, and the Governour of this Our City, to perform this Our Pleasure with all speed. And Our severall Harbingers are hereby required to take notice thereof, and to perform their Offices accordingly, and hereof not to faile.</p>
